This lecture introduces HTML, which is the foundational markup language for web development. Here are the main points covered:

HTML Structure: It explains the basic structure of an HTML document, consisting of a head (for metadata) and a body (for visible content).

Tags and Containers: Most HTML tags function as containers with opening and closing tags, ensuring consistent web page rendering.

Doctype Declaration: The doctype declaration is crucial as it informs the browser about the HTML version in use, specifically HTML5.

Creating HTML Files: The lecture demonstrates creating an HTML file named 'index.html', highlighting this as a standard practice for web servers. The instructor also showcases VS Code shortcuts for efficient coding using the Emmet feature.

Live Server Extension: The use of the Live Server extension in VS Code is introduced, allowing real-time visualization of web pages as code is written.

Basic Tags: The lecture concludes with the creation of basic HTML elements like headings and paragraphs, emphasizing the title tag's importance in the head section.
