/* 
Summarize ====================>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This lecture focuses on foundational concepts in JavaScript, particularly data types, variables, and constants. Here are the main points:

Console Log Command: The importance of using the console log for debugging and output is emphasized as a critical skill for all programmers.

Data Types: Various JavaScript data types are discussed, including:

Strings: Sets of characters.
Numbers: Numeric values.
Booleans: Either true or false values.
BigInts, Undefined, Null, Objects, and Symbols: Each type has its own characteristics, with undefined indicating a lack of definition and null representing an empty value.
Variables: Variables are introduced as placeholders for data. The lecture explains how to declare them using keywords like 'var', 'let', and 'const', highlighting the immutability of constants defined with 'const'.

Variable Manipulation: The syntax for creating and manipulating variables is covered, including printing their values and the importance of meaningful variable names for code readability.

Next Steps: The session ends with a promise to explore mathematical operations in the next lecture, underscoring that programming is about simplifying complex calculations.
