Summarize ===============>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This lecture focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript, highlighting its importance in modern programming. Here are the main points covered:

Objects and Classes: Everything in JavaScript is an object, including classes. It introduces object literals and how to define properties and methods.

Encapsulation: This involves bundling data and methods to restrict access to some components of an object, promoting data hiding.

Inheritance: It explains how one class can inherit properties from another, exemplified by a 'Vehicle' class and a 'Car' class, facilitating code reuse.

Prototypal Inheritance: This covers the prototypal chain in JavaScript, allowing objects to inherit from other objects.

Constructor Functions: These are defined to create multiple instances of an object, sharing properties and methods.

Class Syntax: The modern class syntax from ES6 is presented, detailing how to define classes and methods without using the function keyword.

Error Handling: Common errors are discussed, particularly the importance of using the 'new' keyword when creating instances of classes.
