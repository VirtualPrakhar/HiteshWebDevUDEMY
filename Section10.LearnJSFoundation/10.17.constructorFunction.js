Summarize ===============>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This lecture focuses on functional constructors in JavaScript and how they differ from traditional object-oriented programming. Here are the main points:

Understanding Functional Programming: Importance of grasping functional programming principles before diving into constructor syntax.

Constructor Function: Introduces constructor functions as blueprints for creating multiple objects with shared properties and methods.

Best Practices: Emphasizes the use of the 'function' keyword and the convention of capitalizing the first letter of the function name.

Using 'this' Keyword: Explains how 'this' refers to the newly created object within a constructor function.

Object Instantiation: Covers how to instantiate objects using the 'new' keyword to create instances while retaining their unique properties.

Prototypes: Discusses how prototypes can be used to add methods to constructor functions, with an example involving an 'Animal' constructor.

Error Handling: Introduces methods to check if a constructor function is called without 'new' and how to throw errors for proper usage.

Overall, it provides a comprehensive overview of functional constructors, covering key concepts such as constructor functions, the 'this' keyword, object instantiation, prototypes, and error handling.
